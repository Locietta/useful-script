# Useful-Scripts

My automation, keymaps & dotfiles for Windows and WSL (maybe MSYS2?).

Use `bootstrap.ps1` to deploy on new machines. 

* `config`: terminal prompts and other dotfiles
* `injecter`: scripts used as injecters warpped for apps and services
* `wrappers`: wrap MSYS2/WSL2 commands for Windows to use
