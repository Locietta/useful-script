## Custom Prompts

These are my custom prompts~

* `arcane_v3.json` is for [Oh-My-Posh V3](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh), it's said to be cross-shell usable. *Not implement git&virtualenv part, for some unfixed issues in V3*.
* `arcane.psm1` is for [Oh-My-Posh V2](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh2), works with PowerShell.
* `arcane.zsh-theme` is for [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), works with zsh.
* `arcane_prompt.ps1` is native for PowerShell. To use it, you need to source this in your profile. *No need to install any modules*.
