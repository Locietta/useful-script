## Custom Prompts

These are my custom PS1 prompt - arcane:

* `arcane_prompt.ps1` is native for PowerShell. To use it, you need to source this (i.e. `. path\to\arcane_prompt.ps1`) in your profile.
* `arcane.zsh` is native for zsh. Just source it in `.zshrc` to use it. Drop dependency on oh-my-zsh, at cost with less powerful git prompt.

**Deprecated:**

* `arcane_v3.json` is for [Oh-My-Posh V3](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh), it's said to be cross-shell usable. *Not implement git&virtualenv part, for some unfixed issues in V3*.
* `arcane.psm1` is for [Oh-My-Posh V2](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh2).
* `arcane.zsh-theme` is for [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
